# BankAccount Project

This project implements a BankAccount class that models a simple bank account with strict validation rules for both email addresses and monetary values. The class supports deposits, withdrawals, and transfers while ensuring that invalid data cannot be stored or used. The implementation focuses on input validation, exception handling, and predictable balance updates.

The BankAccount class contains two instance variables: a String email representing the email associated with the account, and a double balance representing the current account balance. The constructor initializes a BankAccount object only if both the email and the starting balance pass validation. If either the email or the balance is invalid, the constructor throws an IllegalArgumentException.

The getBalance method returns the current balance stored in the account, and the getEmail method returns the email associated with the account. The deposit method increases the account balance by the specified amount, provided the amount is valid. An IllegalArgumentException is thrown if the deposit amount is negative or contains an unacceptable number of decimal places. The withdraw method reduces the account balance by the specified amount if the amount is valid and does not exceed the current balance. An IllegalArgumentException is thrown for invalid amounts, and an InsufficientFundsException is thrown if the withdrawal amount exceeds the available balance. The transfer method moves money from one BankAccount object to another, reducing the balance of the source account and increasing the balance of the destination account. The same validation rules apply, and the method throws an IllegalArgumentException for invalid amounts or an InsufficientFundsException if insufficient funds are available.

The isAmountValid method verifies that a monetary value is non-negative and contains at most two decimal places. Values that include additional trailing zeros caused by floating-point representation are accepted. Examples of valid values include 25, 25.1, 25.10, and 25.100000, while values such as 1.005 or 31.0049 are considered invalid. The isEmailValid method verifies that an email address follows the required formatting rules. The email must not be null or empty, must contain exactly one '@' symbol, and may contain only letters, digits, periods, hyphens, or underscores. Special characters cannot appear at the beginning or end of either the address or domain portion, cannot appear consecutively, and the domain must include a suffix of at least two characters. Spaces and prohibited symbols are not allowed.

The project includes unit tests written using JUnit 5 to verify constructor behavior, balance retrieval, amount validation, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and email validation. Floating-point comparisons use a small tolerance to prevent failures caused by precision limitations of the double data type. The project can be compiled using javac BankAccount.java and tests can be executed through an IDE or any environment configured with JUnit 5 support.
